Goal:
Collect and analyze new contract creations on the ETH mainnet.
Gather information on transactions and other events related to these contracts.
Stretch: find liquidity pools or other interesting things and analyze the price action.



TODO:
Make a thing that collects the new contract creations from the ETH mainnet and stores them in a database.
    Directly fetching new contracts through Etherscan.
        Optionally, we can swtich to a Node provider.
        Finding a way to do this through likley contract creation events seems like a good alternative.
